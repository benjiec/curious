Curious
=======

Curious helps you explore your relational data. Instead of writing SQL queries,
a user can use the Curious web UI to a) make Django ORM style queries, b)
explore relationships from objects, c) follow relationships recursively and
across different databases, and d) save useful relationships and reload their
results at anytime.

Curious works with Django models; you can use Curious to explore data created
by your existing Django applications, or build Django models to shadow
non-Django managed databases (e.g. fairly trivial to do this for ActiveRecord
databases). User queries operate on models and instances, and specify model to
model relationships to traverse. A relationship can be an foreign key or many
to many relationship defined by the models, or registered methods that traverse
across multiple models (for convenience or performance) or even databases.
